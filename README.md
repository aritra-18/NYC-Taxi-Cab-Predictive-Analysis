New York Taxi Cab Ride Analysis: Predicting Tips and Revenue

This project analyzes a dataset of NYC taxi cab rides to gain insights into customer payment behavior and predict tip amounts. The dataset includes attributes like trip distance, total amount, fare amount, and payment type. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify outliers and visualize important patterns. It highlights the significance of EDA in understanding the data and preparing it for modeling. The project utilizes multiple linear regression for predictive modeling, feature selection, and model evaluation. Recommendations are provided for optimizing revenue and improving understanding of tipping patterns. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook contains code, analysis, and visualizations.
